# thalidomide-co-expression

This repository contain the R script for the analysis performed in the “Comparative genomics for thalidomide embryopathy: major divergences in anti-angiogenesis genes and further clues in Crbn-Sall4 mechanism” manuscript, under review in Frontiers in Genetics.

All the data analyzed can be encountered in the GEO and the ExpressionArray databases.

All the functions used are available in the packages to be installed for the analysis (instructions in the R Script).

The packages are from CRAN and Bioconductor repositories.

The list of candidate genes analyzed in the study is available in file "genes.txt".
The list of genes of the NF-kB pathway, used for confirmatory purposes, is available in "genes_NFKB.txt" file.
